# Shopping cart program

This is a simple Python program that allows a user to input food items and their prices into a shopping cart, then calculates the total cost of the items in the cart.

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply execute the ```shopping_cart.py``` script using Python.

## How to Use

1. When the program is first run, it will prompt the user to enter a food item to buy, or "q" to quit.

2. If the user enters a valid food item (i.e. not "q" and not a number), the program will prompt the user to enter the price of the item in dollars and cents.

3. If the user enters a valid price (i.e. a positive number), the item and its price will be added to the cart.

4. Steps 1-3 will repeat until the user enters "q" to quit.

5. Once the user has finished adding items to the cart, the program will display the list of items in the cart and the total cost.
